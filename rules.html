                DIMENSIONS.IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
                dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
                These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
                teams under 12 and older

                associations participating in the state competition program that
                are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
                requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions
                should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations
                that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required
